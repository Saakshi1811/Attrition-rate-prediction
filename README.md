# Attrition-rate-prediction

1.Problem Statement:
To build the machine learning model using various algorithms to find the attrition rate.

2. Responsibilities:
• Data analysis on the raw data collected from different resources to check the quality of data. Development of ML pipeline to predict the output.
• Performing EDA , visualization ,feature engineering operations.
• Training model using ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, SVM, ANN with hyperparameter tuning for best parameter selection. Selection of best model and testing the dataset to get results.
• Grouping of data using cluster algorithms- K Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN
